  <h3>A-level/GCSE/IB Physics Teacher</h3>
</header>

After my undergraduate studies, I dedicated a few months to full-time teaching high school students as a tutor. During this period, I covered a wide range of subjects, including kinematics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and more. Some of my former students are currently studying Economics in LSE and Cambridge.
