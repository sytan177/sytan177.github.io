A-level/GCSE/IB Physics Teacher
High school, , 2019

After my undergraduate studies, I dedicated a few months to full-time teaching high school students as a tutor. During this period, I covered a wide range of subjects, including kinematics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and more. Some of my former students are currently studying Economics in LSE and Cambridge.
