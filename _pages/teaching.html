  <h3 class='mtn'>Lab Demonstrator</h3>
</header>
I worked as a lab demonstrator for two core physics courses of second-year undergraduate students: PHYS2261: Introductory heat and thermodynamics and PHYS2255: Introductory electricity and magnetism. The labs were scheduled once a week for a duration of 3 hours each.

I converted and edited all 24 chapters of the Galactic Dynamics (graduate) course notes into an electronic format using LaTeX. You could find some examples <a href="/files/notesdemo.pdf">here</a>.

  <h3>A-level/GCSE/IB Physics Teacher</h3>
</header>

After my undergraduate studies, I dedicated a few months to full-time teaching high school 
students as a tutor. During this period, I covered a wide range of subjects, including kinematics, 
thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and more. Some of my former students are currently 
studying Economics in LSE and Cambridge. You could find some notes I made for my students <a href="/files/On_the_move.pdf">here</a>.
