# Lab demonstration in The University of Hong Kong, 2020 <br />

I worked as a lab demonstrator for two core physics courses of second-year undergraduate students. The labs were scheduled once a week for a duration of 3 hours each.

High school, , 2019

After my undergraduate studies, I dedicated a few months to full-time teaching high school students as a tutor. During this period, I covered a wide range of subjects, including kinematics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and more. Some of my former students are currently studying Economics in LSE and Cambridge.
