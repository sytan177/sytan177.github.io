My research primarily focused on understanding the evolution of our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. My MPhil research was primarily on tracing the chemical evolution in the Galactic bulge using VLT spectroscopic observations of 136 planetary nebulae (PNe). This involved improving the data reduction procedure for this particular sample, interpreting their spectra, and performing statistical analysis. I combined machine-learning and statistical methods to estimate the ages of their progenitor stars and investigate how their metallicities change over time. Additionally, I studied the morphologies and position angles of the PNe using their VLT and HST images. This research will result in a series of six publications. 

During my undergraduate research, I studied the phase-space snail-shell structure uncovered by Gaia DR2 data around the solar neighborhood (within 1 kpc). I re-examined whether a phase mixing event could result in the observed phase-space distributions by building a toy model in a 6-d phase space, following the method in Antoja et al. (2018).
