My research primarily focused on understanding the evolution of our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. My [MPhil](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/programmes/regulations_for_the_degree_of_master_of_philosophy_mphil#:~:text=A%20candidate%20registered%20for%20the,September%201%20or%20January%201.) research was on tracing the chemical evolution in the Galactic bulge using VLT spectroscopic observations of 136 planetary nebulae (PNe). This involved improving the data reduction procedure for this particular sample, interpreting their spectra, and performing statistical analysis. I combined machine-learning and statistical methods to estimate the ages of their progenitor stars and investigate how their metallicities change over time. Additionally, I studied the [morphologies](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac3490) and [position angles](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acdbcd) of the PNe using their VLT and _HST_ images. This research will result in a series of six [publications](https://sytan177.github.io/publications/).

During my undergraduate at Imperial, I engaged in a wide range of physics [courses](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/study/programme-specifications/physics/BSc-Physics-Final.pdf). In my research project, I studied the phase-space snail-shell structure uncovered by _Gaia_ DR2 data around the solar neighborhood (within 1 kpc), in which I re-examined whether a phase mixing event could result in the observed phase-space distributions by building a toy model in a 6-d phase space, following the method in Antoja et al. (2018). 

As a way to unwind, I am a lifelong avid enthusiast of [city walking](https://sytan177.github.io/docs/citywalk.html) and Sudoku (definitely not an expert).
