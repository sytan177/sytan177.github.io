My MPhil project is based on an excellent set of VLT observations of 136 planetary nebulae (PNe) located in the Galactic bulge (PI: Rees). These observations include PNe with catalogued angular sizes ranging from 2 to 10 arcseconds. The figure below illustrates their distribution across the Galaxy, with objects that have been imaged by _HST_ marked by orange scatter.
